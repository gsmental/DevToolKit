 For those running IIS on Windows Server:

By default, the IIS user does not have write permissions for the wwwroot folder. This can be solved by granting full permissions to the IIS_IUSRS user for wwwroot.

Open File Explorer and go to C:/inetpub/
Right click on wwwroot and click on "Properties"
Go to the Security tab and click "Edit..." to edit permissions
Find and select the IIS user. In my case, it was called IIS_IUSRS ([server name]\IIS_IUSRS).
Select the "Allow" checkbox for all permissions.
